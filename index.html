            <h1>Hi. I'm Trieu Nguyen</h1>
            <p>I want to introduce myself so you are interested in getting to know me better. I'll share more here on what I do professional so that people that are looking for those skills will want to hire me.</p>
            <p>After graduating college, I became a banker and worked with diversified groups of clients from many different backgrounds. I found myself enjoy collaborating with my team to solve clients' problems and that made me interested in becoming a programmer.</p>

            <p>During my free time, I enjoy reading books & article about investing. I found it's very fascinating when I picked the right stock and see the company doing well.</p>
            <p>I've also developed a new habit of coding for 5-6 hours every day since I started the coding bootcamp at Thinkful. I can't wait to see what skills I will acquire after I graduated from the program.</p>
